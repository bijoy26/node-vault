Addressing NPM's drawbacks, facebook has developed 'Yarn' package manager based on NPM.
Yarn is smooth, high efficient, developer friendly and more secure than NPM.

Under the hood, yarn uses the same NPM packages but maintains them themselves.

To install Yarn in windows - 
	$> npm install yarn
	$> yarn set version latest

Install a new package using Yarn -
	$> yarn add react

Recommended VS Code Extensions-
	1. AirBnB Guideline - Developed by AirBnB, this extension makes sure that JS code is following certain rules (used in React internally) and best practises.		
	2. ESLint - Most popular JS Linter that finds and fixes problem in JS code.
	3  Prettier - Code formatter that formats and aligns the code.

NOTE: ESLint and Prettier follow different standards and it's likely to have conflicting rules between them.For such case, one of their rules need to be disabled.

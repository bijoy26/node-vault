The system would have 3 specific endpoints-
    1. Authentication (AuthN) Server
    2. Authorization (AuthZ) Server
    3. Get-Resource

When user interacts with the system first time -
            1. AuthN crafts a JWT and sends back to client
            2. Client calls Get-Resource() using the token
            3. Get-Resource() returns client side resources list in json data.
               Whether client is using Angular or React, it would load the front end and show/hide contents in dashboard
